  <h1>About</h1>

  <h2>What is Episteme?</h2>
  <p>
    Episteme is a growing collection of physics models and simulations designed to make complex physical concepts easier to understand and explore. Each simulation is paired with clear documentation — from how the math works, to how the code was written — so that anyone can follow the logic behind the physics. Whether it's a classical pendulum or quantum mechanics, the goal is to make each topic approachable, visual, and intuitive.
  </p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Many students around the world lack access to experimental setups or quality resources to study physics deeply. Episteme exists to fill that gap — by creating open, hands-on models of the very experiments and ideas that shape modern physics. The platform aims to inspire curiosity and support learning through visual, interactive, and well-explained tools. It's not just about watching a simulation — it's about understanding why it works.
