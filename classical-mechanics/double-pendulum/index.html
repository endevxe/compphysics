<h1>Double Pendulum Simulation</h1>

<p>
  The double pendulum consists of two pendulums attached end to end.
  It is a classic example of a simple system that exhibits chaotic behavior —
  small differences in starting conditions lead to vastly different outcomes.
</p>

<h2>1&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Equations of Motion</h2>
<p>
  The system has two angular coordinates: \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
  Using Lagrangian mechanics, we derive a set of coupled second-order differential equations.
  These are nonlinear and contain terms like \( \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2) \),
  making the system highly sensitive to initial conditions.
</p>

<p>
  The equations are reduced to four first-order ODEs for \( \theta_1, \omega_1, \theta_2, \omega_2 \),
  where \( \omega_i = \frac{d\theta_i}{dt} \), and solved numerically using the 4th-order Runge–Kutta method (RK4).
</p>

<h2>2&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Numerical Method</h2>
<p>
  The RK4 method is used to evolve the system in time. It evaluates four intermediate slopes per time step
  and combines them to produce an accurate next value. This is crucial for chaotic systems where precision matters.
</p>

<h2>3&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;No Real-World Data Needed</h2>
<p>
  The system is modeled in dimensionless units: \( m = L = g = 1 \).
  This lets us understand the ideal behavior of the system without using physical data.
  It's useful for visualizing how energy and chaos emerge in theoretical setups.
</p>

<h2>4&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;What You’ll See</h2>
<p>
  The animation shows the two pendulum bobs moving. You will notice that their motion is smooth at first,
  but soon becomes unpredictable due to chaotic dynamics. A red trail follows the second pendulum bob to show its path.
