  <h1>Electric Field Line Visualization</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Electric field lines are a visual representation of the direction and strength of electric fields generated by electric charges. They provide an intuitive way to understand how positive and negative charges interact with their surroundings.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Mathematical Foundation</h2>
  <p>
    The electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point in space due to a point charge \( q \) is given by:
  </p>
  <p>
    $$
    \vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}
    $$
  </p>
  <p>
    where \( r \) is the distance from the charge, \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector in the radial direction, and \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the vacuum permittivity. For multiple charges, the net electric field is the vector sum of the individual fields.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Simulation Approach</h2>
  <p>
    We simulate the electric field by calculating the vector field on a 2D grid due to a configuration of point charges. Field lines are visualized using stream plots, which trace the path a test charge would follow under the influence of the field.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Vector Field and Stream Plots</h2>
  <p>
    Using libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib in Python, we:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Define a grid of points</li>
    <li>Calculate the electric field vector at each point</li>
    <li>Plot the field using quiver (for arrows) or streamplot (for smooth field lines)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Streamlines are particularly helpful for visualizing how a test charge would move in the presence of multiple charges, revealing symmetric patterns and null points.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Idealized Conditions</h2>
  <p>
    Since this is a theoretical model, we assume point charges in vacuum and ignore any boundary effects. No experimental data is required — the fields are derived directly from Coulomb's Law.
  </p>
