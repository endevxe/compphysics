<h1>The One‑Dimensional Schrödinger Equation</h1>

<p>
  The Schrödinger equation is the central tool of non‑relativistic quantum mechanics.
  In its time‑independent form it reads
  \[
     -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}\psi(x)}{dx^{2}} + V(x)\,\psi(x) = E\,\psi(x),
  \]
  where \( \psi(x) \) is the stationary wavefunction, \( E \) is the corresponding energy,
  \( m \) is the particle mass, and \( V(x) \) is the external potential.
  Once \( V(x) \) is specified, boundary conditions fix the allowed energies and the
  shapes of the eigenfunctions.
</p>

<h2>1&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;The Infinite Square Well (“Particle in a Box”)</h2>

<p>
  In the simplest textbook case the particle is trapped
  between two infinitely high walls a distance \( L \) apart.
  Inside the box the potential is zero; outside, it is infinite,
  so the wavefunction must vanish at the walls.
  Inside the well the equation reduces to
  \[
     \frac{d^{2}\psi}{dx^{2}} + k^{2}\psi = 0,\qquad
     k^{2} = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^{2}}.
  \]
  Imposing \( \psi(0)=\psi(L)=0 \) gives the familiar sine solutions
  \[
     \psi_n(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\!\Bigl(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\Bigr),\qquad
     E_n=\frac{n^{2}\pi^{2}\hbar^{2}}{2mL^{2}},\quad n=1,2,3,\dots
  \]
  A finite‑difference matrix built from the second‑derivative operator reproduces
  these results numerically; the script
  <code>schrodinger.py</code> diagonalises that matrix and plots the first four
  eigenstates.
</p>

<h2>2&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Exploring Many Infinite‑Well States</h2>

<p>
  Although a finite‑difference approach works, the analytic formula above allows us
  to plot dozens of eigenfunctions in a fraction of a second.  The helper program
  <code>many_states_infinite_well.py</code> simply evaluates the sine expression
  for any desired quantum number \( n \) and offsets each curve vertically so that
  they do not overlap.  Running it reveals the progressive increase in nodes and
  energy spacing as \( n \) grows.
</p>

<h2>3&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;The Finite Square Well</h2>

<p>
  If the walls are given a finite height \( V_{0} \) instead of being infinite,
  the particle can tunnel slightly into the barrier region.
  Bound states still exist when \( E&lt;V_{0} \),
  but their energies are lower than in the infinite case and the wavefunctions
  develop exponential tails.
  In <code>finite_square_well.py</code> a shooting method integrates the equation
  from one wall to the centre of the well while adjusting \( E \) until the
  boundary conditions are met;
  the resulting energies and normalised wavefunctions are then plotted.
</p>

<h2>4&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Time‑Dependent Wave Packet</h2>

<p>
  A stationary state never changes shape, but real quantum particles often begin
  as localised wave packets.
  The split‑operator method propagates such a packet by alternating short
  “kicks” from the kinetic and potential energy operators.
  In <code>wavepacket_split_operator.py</code> a Gaussian packet starts near the
  left wall and bounces back and forth inside the well.
  Frames are saved every few time steps and stacked with vertical offsets so that
  the spreading and interference patterns are easy to see.
</p>

<h2>5&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Numerical Ingredients</h2>

<p>
  All simulations set \( \hbar = m = L = 1 \).  These choices simply fix the
  length, mass and energy scales so no experimental data are required.
  Finite‑difference grids convert derivatives into sparse matrices, while the
  split‑operator algorithm relies on the Fast Fourier Transform to switch
  quickly between position and momentum space.
  Diagonalisation uses standard linear‑algebra routines from
  <code>numpy.linalg</code>, and integration for the finite well uses
  <code>scipy.integrate.solve_ivp</code>.
