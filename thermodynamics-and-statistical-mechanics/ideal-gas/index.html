<h1>Ideal Gas Simulation</h1>

<p>
  This project models a collection of particles in a 2D box behaving as an ideal gas. 
  Each particle undergoes elastic collisions with the box walls. The simulation tracks 
  how their velocity distribution evolves, and compares it with the theoretical 
  Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.
</p>

<h2>1 · Ideal Gas Assumptions</h2>
<p>
  The simulation assumes:
  <ul>
    <li>Particles are point-like with no interaction except for collisions.</li>
    <li>Elastic collisions with container walls conserve energy.</li>
    <li>No inter-particle collisions (can be added for realism).</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>2 · Velocity Distribution</h2>
<p>
  As time progresses, even if initialized with arbitrary speeds, the system’s velocity 
  distribution naturally approaches the Maxwell–Boltzmann form:
  \[
    f(v) = \frac{m}{k_B T} v \exp\left( -\frac{m v^2}{2 k_B T} \right)
  \]
  In 2D, this form is modified slightly, but the key shape and behavior remains.
</p>

<h2>3 · Simulation Goals</h2>
<p>
  The animation shows two things:
  <ol>
    <li>Particles moving in the box and bouncing off the walls.</li>
    <li>A histogram of their speeds over time compared to the Maxwell–Boltzmann curve.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>4 · Observations</h2>
<p>
  Over time, the velocity distribution becomes smoother and more bell-shaped. 
  The simulation demonstrates how energy spreads naturally in a system of free 
  particles due to random motion, even without explicit interactions.
