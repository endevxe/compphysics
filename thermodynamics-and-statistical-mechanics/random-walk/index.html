<h1>Brownian Motion, Random Walk & Diffusion</h1>

<p>
  The erratic motion of pollen grains observed by Robert Brown is now understood
  as the cumulative effect of countless molecular collisions.  In statistical
  mechanics this is idealised as a <em>random walk</em>: at each time step a
  particle makes an independent, random step of fixed length.
</p>

<h2>1 · Lattice Random Walk Model</h2>

<p>
  In two dimensions we let the walker start at the origin and move one lattice
  spacing in one of four cardinal directions with equal probability.  Repeating
  this for many walkers produces an ensemble suitable for averaging.
</p>

<h2>2 · Mean‑Square Displacement</h2>

<p>
  A hallmark of diffusion is that the mean‑square displacement (MSD)
  grows linearly with time:
  \[
      \langle r^{2}(t) \rangle = 4 D t
      \quad\text{(in 2‑D)} ,
  \]
  where \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient.  By fitting a straight line to
  the simulated MSD curve we can <strong>derive \( D \)</strong> directly from
  the random walk data, without any external measurement.
</p>

<h2>3 · Monte‑Carlo Simulation</h2>

<p>
  The script initialises thousands of independent walkers, advances each one in
  parallel, and records \( \langle r^{2} \rangle \) after every step.
  A simple linear regression on the MSD versus step number yields
  the slope and therefore the diffusion coefficient via \( D = \text{slope}/4 \).
</p>

<h2>4 · Results & Interpretation</h2>

<p>
  At long times the MSD points fall neatly on a straight line, confirming
  diffusive behaviour.  Deviations at early times reflect the discrete
  lattice nature and finite sampling.  Increasing the number of walkers
  reduces statistical noise; increasing the number of steps extends the
  range over which the linear fit is valid.
